# Swapi Project

Star wars API project for MMED 6007 - Advanced Web Tech

## Reasoning

This project was created to show off proficiency in manipulating APIs created by a third party on the frontend. As such we've been tasked creating a project with [swapi](https://swapi.co/), the _Star Wars_ API. I've also included the [bulma](https://bulma.io/) CSS library to try to use a css library that I am not familiar with.
